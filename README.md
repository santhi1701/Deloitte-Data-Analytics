# Deloitte Australia Data Analytics Job Simulation (Forage)

This repository contains my submissions for the Deloitte STEM Virtual Program. As part of this program, participants assist Daikibo Industrials, a global leader in heavy machinery manufacturing, in tackling various operational challenges. This repository documents my completion of three courses in the Deloitte Virtual Internship on Forage.

Deloitte - Data Analytics
Task 1: Data Analysis
Daikibo's tech team compiled one monthâ€™s telemetry data (May 2021) from four factories:

Daikibo Factory Meiyo (Tokyo, Japan)
Daikibo Factory Seiko (Osaka, Japan)
Daikibo Berlin (Berlin, Germany)
Daikibo Shenzhen (Shenzhen, China)
Each site operates nine types of machines, reporting status updates every 10 minutes. The goal is to analyze:

Which location experienced the most machine failures?
Which machines had the highest failure rate at that location?
Key Learnings:

Utilizing Tableau to create interactive dashboards
Extracting insights from large datasets
Task 2: Forensic Technology
Due to internal concerns over gender pay inequality, Daikibo wants to quantify the fairness of compensation across various job roles and locations. The Forensic Technology team has developed an algorithm to measure gender pay equality.

Key Learnings:

Applying Excel functions for data analysis and pattern recognition
